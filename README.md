# Foundations-of-Robotics-NYU


The objective of our project is to explore and implement key robotics concepts, focusing on the kinematics, visualization and dynamics of David Bowen’s Plant Machete robot. The resemblance, especially in terms of the six degrees of freedom and the physical design of the links, guided our decision to model our project on the Ufactory Xarm 6.

We implemented our project, utilizing MATLAB as our primary tool for executing the tasks of the project, which included the development of forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, pose visualization, application of the Jacobian method in both inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics, and workspace visualization.
